        "Our class `FlowerClient` defines how local training/evaluation will be performed and allows Flower to call the local training/evaluation through `fit` and `evaluate`. Each instance of `FlowerClient` represents a *single client* in our federated learning system. Federated learning systems have multiple clients (otherwise, there's not much to federate), so each client will be represented by its own instance of `FlowerClient`. If we have, for example, three clients in our workload, then we'd have three instances of `FlowerClient` (one on each of the machines we'd start the client on). Flower calls `FlowerClient.fit` on the respective instance when the server selects a particular client for training (and `FlowerClient.evaluate` for evaluation).\n",
        "\n",

This means that the server and all 10 clients will live on a single machine and share resources such as CPU, GPU, and memory. Having 10 clients would mean having 10 instances of `FlowerClient` in memory. Doing this on a single machine can quickly exhaust the available memory resources, even if only a subset of these clients participates in a single round of federated learning.\n",

        "In addition to the regular capabilities where server and clients run on multiple machines, Flower, therefore, provides special simulation capabilities that create `FlowerClient` instances only when they are actually necessary for training or evaluation. To enable the Flower framework to create clients when necessary, we need to implement a function that creates a `FlowerClient` instance on demand. We typically call this function `client_fn`. Flower calls `client_fn` whenever it needs an instance of one particular client to call `fit` or `evaluate` (those instances are usually discarded after use, so they should not keep any local state). In federated learning experiments using Flower, clients are identified by a partition ID, or `partition-id`. This `partition-id` is used to load different local data partitions for different clients, as can be seen below. The value of `partition-id` is retrieved from the `node_config` dictionary in the `Context` object, which holds the information that persists throughout each training round.\n",

Last, but definitely not least, we create an instance of `ClientApp` and pass it the `client_fn`. `ClientApp` is the entrypoint that a running Flower client uses to call your code (as defined in, for example, `FlowerClient.fit`)."

When the `ServerApp` receives the model parameter updates from the clients, it hands those updates over to the strategy (*FedAvg*) for aggregation.
